        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>I'm feeling all the soups with this colder weather and this one is quick and easy to make! Sweet, Gingery, and simple!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil (or water/broth)⁠
                <li>½ medium onion, chopped⁠</li>
                <li>3 cloves garlic, minced⁠</li>
                <li>¼ tsp salt and pepper (more to taste)⁠</li>
                <li>2 tbsp fresh ginger, minced⁠</li>
                <li>6 cups carrots (5–6 large carrots, diced)⁠</li>
                <li>4 cups broth (homemade for extra thriftiness)⁠</li>
                <li>1 ½ cups soy milk⁠</li>
                <li>2 tbsp maple syrup</li>
                <li>optional: additional 1 tbsp of maple syrup⁠</li>
                <li>optional: pinch of cayenne⁠</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot, heat the oil (or water/broth) over medium low heat and saute the onion and garlic.</li>
            Season with salt and pepper and cook 2-3 minutes until the onion is translucent and the garlic fragrant.
            <li>Add the minced ginger and cook for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped carrots, stir, and cover with the lid. Allow the carrots to steam for 5 minutes. </li>
            Stir once or twice to make sure the carrots aren’t sticking. Add a dash of water or broth if needed.
            <li>Add the vegetable broth, raise the heat a bit, cover the pot with the lid and bring the soup to a boil.</li>
            <li>Lower the heat and simmer with the lid on for 15 minutes or until the carrots are soft and easily pierced with a fork.</li>
            <li>Use an immersion blender or carefully transfer the soup to a stand up blender if it can process hot liquids.</li>
            Blend until smooth. Stir in the milk and maple syrup and heat the soup over low heat for another few minutes until 
            heated through and all the flavours have combined. Taste and add more maple syrup if desired or cayenne for heat.</li>
        </ol>
